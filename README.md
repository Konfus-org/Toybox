# About

Toybox is a simple, light-weight, plugin based, open source game engine that is currently in development.
There isn't much here yet but, hopefully, soon there will be!

# How to build

Toybox is built using premake. The repo contains a "makeproj.bat" script that you can run (if on windows) to generate a visual studio project.
If on another platform you will have to manually invoke the premake exe located undo "Tools/Premake". If unfamiliar with premake look to: https://premake.github.io/ to learn how to use it.
