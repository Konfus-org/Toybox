## About

Toybox is a simple, light-weight, plugin based, open source game engine that is currently in development.
There isn't much here yet but, hopefully, soon there will be!

## How to build

Toybox uses premake to generate project files for different build environments.
The repo contains a "makeproj.bat" script that you can run (if on windows) to generate a visual studio project.
If you are on another platform you will have to manually invoke the premake exe located under "Tools/Premake".
To learn how to use premake look to: https://premake.github.io/.
