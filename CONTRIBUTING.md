### Contributing

## Coding Guidelines
- Target modern C++20 without compiler extensions or C++ attributes unless required for platform compatibility.
- Keep interfaces in headers and implementation details in source files, preferring #pragma once.
- Use descriptive names (avoid catch-all names like Util) and follow SOLID principles where practical.
- Maintain existing formatting conventions and keep builds free of warnings.
- Add automated tests when introducing new functionality.
